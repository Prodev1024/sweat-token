## Development

To start the development environment use `docker-compose up -d`

It will start three containers for `frontend`, `backend` and `contracts` mounting on the local directory

You can obtain logs for each container while developing with
- frontend `docker-compose logs -f frontend`
- backend `docker-compose logs -f backend`
- contracts `docker-compose logs -f contracts`
